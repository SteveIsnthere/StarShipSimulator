## Shipped

- **The rebuild is live** at https://steveisnthere.github.io/StarShipSimulator/ in place of the 2021 game. Returning visitors' 2021 service worker is retired by a kill switch; the 2021 game is tag `v0-classic`, and branch `classic` is the one-command rollback (`docs/reference/architecture.md`).
- **A gate that is green on your Mac and in hosted CI.** Before: 48 of 1,585 unit tests red on arm64, CI green 2 of 132 runs. The complete local main gate is green at `c2ae5e4`; hosted CI and Pages succeed. The two existing hosted menu flakes remain named for Phase 9.
- **A truth harness.** Cited reference bands with a ratchet (`npm run truth:report`), property invariants over every configurable flight, a mutation matrix the suite must turn red (`npm run mutation`, 21 of 21 caught), a debug surface and a browser witness with a positive control.
- **Two real physics bugs fixed**, both found by the new tests: the tank went negative on the emptying step, and the flight editor accepted negative propellant (a vehicle lighter than its own structure).
- **Phase 6, Ship realism** (merged and live): a real Earth (GM, radius, the 1976 atmosphere to its thermosphere), felt g, six Raptors with three fixed RVacs, a heat shield in kelvin against a 1,533 K tile, wind that grows with height and gusts, and a rotating-frame model ready for Earth's spin. Every scenario still lands under autopilot.
- **The design pass**: `docs/design/ux-critique.md`, `design-system.md`, `ia.md`, and the review page below.

## For you to look at

- **The prototype review page** (private): https://claude.ai/artifact/9rAusShWLCkpoHMhoVy5TR — today's interface against the proposed one, surface by surface. Your verdict feeds Phase 4/8 as a scope change.

## Decided on your behalf

- **Pages cut-over executed** as part of Phase 1 (it was in the plan), after an independent review that drove the migration and rollback in a real browser.
- **Goldens**: a measured tolerance (1e-8) off the recording platform, exact on it.
- **Fonts**: Inter / Inter Tight / JetBrains Mono, subset to 52 kB, replacing Barlow.
- **Kit reuse**: flight_sim's `web/src/ui` vendored byte for byte, type-checked under its own settings; nothing in flight_sim changed.
- **Layers pause the flight**, Escape closes the top layer, P pauses (from the IA).

- **Flight screen layout (Phase 4)**: the primary cluster moved from bottom-centre to top-centre. At the bottom it covered the vehicle on the pad and at touchdown. On a phone the world ends above the controls so the camera reframes instead of being covered, and a phone held sideways gets its own compact layout. `docs/design/ia.md` records the change.
- **Flight backing deepened from 62% to 68% black**: the new contrast test measured the label grey at 4.11:1 over a noon sky, under the 4.5:1 floor.
- **Engine states drawn by shape, not blinking**: the old blink tests were passing on nothing; the new specs check the shapes and that reduced motion adds no transition.
- **Bundle budget 250 → 300 kB** for React DOM (275 kB measured), and one design-scanner exception for the throttle slider's measured fill. Both recorded where the rules live; confirm or overrule.

- **Phase 6 calls, made unattended (you are buying these; the model is in `docs/reference/physics-model.md`):**
  - the tile limit is NASA's Shuttle HRSI 1,260 °C (Starship's is not public), so the deorbit may park rather than move the limit;
  - the six-engine UI is minimal now and the look is Phase 9's (UX);
  - *Engines* (all) lights the three sea-level engines, as in 2021;
  - Earth rotation uses a rotating ground frame at Starbase's 26°N, done last;
  - spool-up is the existing ignition transient, not a second invented one;
  - **the landing reserve is measured, not computed (changed during Task 3).** The plan's formula gave 6.3 t, but the landing programme spends 12.0 t engine-out, so a computed reserve would have crashed every deorbit. It is 18 t after Task 4c (the worst engine-out use plus about a third), health-checked the way the deorbit aim is; engine-out deorbits now land with 3.8 t instead of 0.0–0.2 t;
  - **the RVacs (Task 4b)**: 258 tf and 380 s from Wikipedia; the 2.3 m exit is the commonly reported figure with no primary source found. The autopilot lights no RVac in Phase 6 (a vacuum deorbit burn on RVacs is later work); *Engines* (all) lights the sea-level three and shuts everything down. The controls and HUD show six marks in two labelled sets, keys 4–6 for the RVacs: a minimal UI, the look is Phase 9's;
  - **the flip trigger plans on the slowest engine start** (1.2 s, Task 4c), not 2021's 0.6 s constant.

## Parked — yours to decide


- **No LICENSE** in a public repo. Choose one before this grows further.
- **Two dead remote branches**, `origin/exp` and `origin/feat/modernize-app`: nothing in either is worth keeping. Delete when you agree.
- **Codex can't run as a peer reviewer**: `~/.codex/config.toml` names `gpt-6.1-sol`, which a ChatGPT login does not support (still so on 2026-10-01, Phase 6's close). ChatGPT Pro and fresh subagents reviewed instead. Changing that lever is yours.

- **Guidance (Phase 5)**: the autopilot's throttle laws, landing-burn sizing and the HUD impact predictor run on the simulation's own gravity, thrust and drag. The flip trigger keeps its one-engine pessimism with no added margin, because a one-engine-out deorbit lands with almost no propellant (the shipped reserve is now 18 t and is independently health-checked).

## Follow-ups recorded for Phase 9 (UX)

- The throttle and yoke sliders follow the simulation only on keys, store changes and when touched, not while the autopilot moves them (the Svelte slider never followed at all).
- The debrief has no grade or comparison with the previous flight yet (ia.md asks for both).

## Incidents

- **2026-10-01, main red for one merge.** Phase 5's goldens were re-blessed on the Mac; they replay bit-exactly only on x86-64 Linux / Node 22, so CI failed in the 16th digit and the deploy did not publish (the live site kept the previous build). Fixed in `3429ea1`: fixtures now come from `.github/workflows/golden-regenerate.yml` (push a branch as `golden/<name>`), `golden:regenerate` refuses anywhere else, and the policy says so.

## Current checkpoint

**Seven of ten phases are complete (70%).** Phase 6b is merged and live at `c2ae5e46a25db0bdd63504a8f93d37056176b069`. It ships Task 5/current-force corrections, independent descent braking, first-loss debrief capture, camera clearance and repaired continuous exhaust. The body-axis/fin/RCS/entry/Earth-rate models remain parked under Steve's independently confirmed fallback; recovery and reasons are in the backlog and physics reference.

Complete main gate passes 1,993 unit/coverage tests, unchanged floors, 13 smoke and five subpath checks. Final branch browser suite passes 480 checks with zero failures/retries and 11 configured skips. Mutation control passes; all 21 faults are caught. Fresh high-depth source review and independent final acceptance are clean.

Hosted CI `37071475434` and Pages `37071475425` succeed at the merge; both gates needed retry 1 for the two existing menu visibility checks. Phase 9 retains that debt. Live smoke passes 5/5 with certificate validation enabled. All 44 served assets and the service worker match verified build `3da4ee45585e`.

[Closure evidence](../../research/2026-10-02-phase6b-close.md) retains raw logs, hashes, exact limits and platform caveats. Prior diagnosis/approval history is in research and Git at `3f003ec`; do not reopen it. Phase 7 Super Heavy is next, then Phase 8 Visuals and Phase 9 UX. No Phase 7 implementation has started and no owner question is pending. The active GOAL carries the next bounded task.
