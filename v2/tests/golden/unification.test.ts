/**
 * The fixture audit trail: every time a golden has moved, and what moved it.
 *
 * WHERE THIS CAME FROM. M2.10 removed the fidelity-flag machinery — deleting
 * `core/flags.ts`, four conditional branches in `step()`, a SimState field the
 * integrator read, and seven quadrant ladders — and the honest question about a
 * restructure that large is not "does it still fly" but "is it the SAME
 * simulation". It was, bit for bit: all seven fixtures' rows came out identical
 * to the flag-on recordings from commit 115879c. Rather than keep a second
 * fixture set around to prove that (which would defeat "one physics, one
 * fixture set"), the proof was reduced to a hash of each rows block.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOW. Those hashes turned out to be worth keeping for a second
 * reason: they make every subsequent movement visible and attributable. A tier
 * that claims to move one scenario can be checked against the table below, and
 * a change that moves a fixture nobody expected shows up here first.
 *
 *     M2.10   flags removed                      moved NOTHING — the point
 *     M2.9(a) heatLimit 55 -> 390                re-entry only
 *     M2.11   the dead RCS command               re-entry and RTLS only
 *     M2.12   the doubled tangential term        ALL SEVEN
 *     M2.14   the thermosphere                   booster-sep only
 *
 * Each row is a shape, and the shape is the check. M2.12 moving all seven is
 * not a surprise to be explained away: the term it corrects acts on any vehicle
 * both climbing or falling and moving downrange, which is every scenario except
 * sitting on the pad, and a change that moved fewer would have been the
 * suspicious one. M2.14 moving only booster-sep is the same argument in
 * reverse: it changes the air above 86 km, and booster-sep is the one flight
 * that goes there.
 *
 * REPRODUCING A DIGEST. The rows block is everything from the `"rows": [` line
 * to the end of the file, hashed as written:
 *
 *     sed -n '/^ "rows": \[$/,$p' tests/golden/fixtures/intro-demo.json | shasum -a 256
 *
 * IF ONE MOVES WITHOUT A TIER TO NAME, physics changed by accident. That is the
 * whole job of this file.
